ReasonglInterface
===

Interface over OpenGL and WebGL. This alone isn't very useful, it can be used to write your own implementation for a new target that we're not currently supporting. If you implement all of the function in here, any program written on top of ReasonGL will auto-magically work on that new target. 

See [reasongl](https://github.com/bsansouci/reasongl) for details on how to use this as a library.
